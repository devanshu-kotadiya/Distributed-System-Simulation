# Distributed System Simulation: Fault Tolerance, Scalability, and Monitoring

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a production-oriented simulation of key **distributed systems principles**, focused on the efficient and resilient handling of large-scale data (2.25 GB). It is built to showcase:

- âœ… **Fault Tolerance**: Ensures system reliability and continuity in case of component or node failures.
- âœ… **Horizontal Scalability**: Automatically scales system resources by adding/removing pods to manage increased or reduced workloads.
- âœ… **Load Balancing**: Efficiently distributes incoming traffic and resource demands across multiple pods to maintain optimal performance.
- âœ… **Distributed Monitoring**: Provides real-time insights into system health, resource utilization, and performance metrics.

---
- The dataset is used to stress-test and validate the distributed architecture under realistic data-processing conditions.

---

## ðŸ”§ Features

- **Kubernetes orchestration** for containerized deployment and scalability.
- **Prometheus + Grafana** integration for live system monitoring.
- **Nginx** or **Kubernetes Services** for load balancing.
- **Graceful degradation** and retry logic to ensure resilience in case of failure.

## ðŸ“ˆ Outcomes

- Demonstrated high system availability and fault recovery under node failure conditions.
- Achieved smooth horizontal scaling with minimal performance drops.
- Enabled real-time observability through dashboard metrics and alerts.
